# ADR: User Accounts for Image Management

**Date**: `2023-06-29`

## Status

`Accepted`

## Context

The web application will provide image enhancement features to users, allowing them to enhance their images with various adjustments. However, there arises necessity to provide users with the ability to store and access their enhanced images conveniently. This requires the implementation of user accounts to manage user-specific image galleries.

## Decision

We propose the implementation of user accounts within the web application to address the need for managing enhanced images. This decision involves the following changes:

1. **User Registration**: Users will have the option to create accounts by providing their email address and setting a password.

2. **Login System**: A login system will be implemented to allow users to access their accounts securely. Users will be required to enter their registered username and password to log in.

3. **Google OAuth Integration**: In addition to traditional username and password login, users will have the option to log in using their Google accounts. This integration will provide a seamless and secure login experience through Google OAuth authentication.

4. **User Profiles**: Each user account will have a user profile associated with it, where users can update their personal information, including their profile picture and account details.

5. **Image Gallery**: Upon logging in, users will have access to their personal images gallery, where they can download their enhanced images.

6. **Security Measures**: Robust security measures will be implemented to protect user data and privacy, including encryption of passwords and secure session management.

7. **User Account Management**: Users will have the ability to change their passwords, reset forgotten passwords, and delete their accounts if they wish to do so.

8. **User Feedback**: A feedback mechanism will be provided to users within the application, allowing them to report issues, provide suggestions, or seek assistance.

This decision will effectively address the issue of managing enhanced images and provide users with a seamless experience for storing and accessing their enhanced images, including the added convenience of Google OAuth login.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Improved User Experience**: Users will be able to conveniently store, organize, and access their enhanced images, enhancing their overall experience with the web application.

- **Enhanced Security**: User accounts will provide an additional layer of security, protecting user data and preventing unauthorized access. Google OAuth integration ensures secure authentication.

### Negative Consequences

- **Development Time**: Implementing user accounts and Google OAuth integration will require additional development time and resources.

- **Maintenance**: Ongoing maintenance and support for user accounts and OAuth integration will be necessary to ensure their continued functionality and security.
