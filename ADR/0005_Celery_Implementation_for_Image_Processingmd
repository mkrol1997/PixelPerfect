# ADR: Celery Implementation for Image Processing

Date: `2023-09-01`

## Status

`Accepted`

## Context

In our project, we are developing a feature for image processing that includes tasks such as image upscaling, compression, and artifact removal. These tasks can be computationally intensive and time-consuming, potentially impacting the responsiveness and scalability of our application. To address this, we propose implementing Celery as a task queue system for asynchronous image processing.

## Decision

We propose the implementation of Celery for handling image processing tasks asynchronously. This decision involves the following steps:

1. **Celery Integration**: We will integrate the Celery library into our project to facilitate task queuing and asynchronous execution.

2. **Message Broker**: We will configure a message broker (Redis) to act as an intermediary between our application and Celery, facilitating the distribution of tasks.

3. **Worker Nodes**: Worker nodes will be set up to process Celery tasks. These nodes can be distributed across multiple machines to handle concurrent image processing requests.

This decision to implement Celery for image processing will enable us to offload computationally intensive tasks, improve application responsiveness, and enhance the scalability of our image processing feature.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Improved Application Responsiveness**: Asynchronous image processing with Celery will prevent long-running tasks from blocking the main application, leading to a more responsive user experience.

- **Scalability**: Celery's distributed worker nodes allow us to scale image processing horizontally, ensuring that we can handle increased concurrent requests efficiently.

- **Resource Optimization**: Celery allows us to allocate resources only when needed, optimizing resource usage and reducing processing bottlenecks.

### Negative Consequences

- **Implementation Complexity**: Integrating Celery introduces additional complexity to our project, including setting up and configuring a message broker and managing worker nodes.

- **Monitoring Overhead**: We will need to implement monitoring and scaling mechanisms to ensure efficient worker node allocation and resource usage.
