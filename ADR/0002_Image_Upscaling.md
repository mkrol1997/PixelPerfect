# ADR: Image Upscaling with OpenCV

**Date**: `2023-07-04`

## Status

`Accepted`

## Context

Many users upload old images with low resolution, resulting in artifacts and a suboptimal enhancement outcome. To address this issue and improve the quality of image enhancement, we propose implementing an image upscaling feature using the OpenCV (`cv2`) library.

## Decision

We have decided to incorporate the OpenCV library to perform optional image upscaling before applying any artifact removal algorithms.

This decision will improve the overall quality of image enhancement for users, especially for older images with low resolutions.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Improved Image Quality**: Users will experience better results when enhancing old and low-resolution images, as upscaling will provide a higher-quality input for subsequent enhancements.

- **Enhanced User Satisfaction**: Users will be more satisfied with the image enhancement feature, leading to increased engagement and continued use of our application.

### Negative Consequences

- **Increased Processing Time**: Image upscaling adds an additional processing step, which may increase the time required to complete image enhancements, potentially affecting the user experience.

- **Resource Usage**: Upscaling high-resolution images unnecessarily can consume additional server resources. Careful threshold setting is essential to mitigate this.

- **Complexity**: Integrating OpenCV and managing the upscaling process adds complexity, which may require additional development and testing effort.
