# ADR: Implementing Docker and Docker Compose for Application

Date: `2023-09-10`

## Status

`Accepted`

## Context

In our project, we are developing an application that consists of multiple components, services, and dependencies. Managing the deployment, environment setup, and dependencies across different development and production environments has become increasingly complex. To streamline and simplify these aspects, we propose implementing Docker and Docker Compose for our application.

## Decision

We propose the implementation of Docker and Docker Compose to containerize our application components and manage their orchestration. This decision involves the following steps:

1. **Docker Integration**: We will integrate Docker into our development workflow to create containers for each component of our application, including web server, database, and queue services.

2. **Docker Compose Configuration**: We will create a Docker Compose configuration file (`docker-compose.yml`) to define the relationships and orchestration of these containers. This will simplify the setup of our application's stack.

3. **Development and Production Environments**: Docker Compose will allow us to define different configurations for development, testing, and production environments, ensuring consistency across the entire development lifecycle.

4. **Container Registry Integration**: For production deployments, we will integrate with a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub) to store and manage our container images.

Implementing Docker and Docker Compose will provide us with a consistent and reproducible way to manage our application's environment, dependencies, and deployment across various environments.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Environment Consistency**: Docker containers ensure that each environment, from development to production, is consistent, reducing the "it works on my machine" problem.

- **Simplified Deployment**: Docker Compose simplifies the setup and orchestration of multiple services, making it easier to deploy and manage our application.

- **Isolation**: Containerization provides isolation, allowing different components to run independently without interfering with each other.

- **Scalability**: Docker containers can be easily scaled up or down to handle changes in traffic or demand.

### Negative Consequences

- **Learning Curve**: Team members may need time to become proficient with Docker and Docker Compose, which may require training and documentation.

- **Resource Overhead**: Running containers may consume additional system resources, which need to be managed effectively, especially in production environments.

- **Complexity**: Managing multiple containers and their interactions can introduce complexity, necessitating robust monitoring and orchestration.
