# Usage Instructions

## Image Upscaling

Image upscaling increases the resolution of old images by generating additional pixels.

**To properly use this functionality, follow these steps:**

1. Choose your image input.
2. Select one of the four supported upscaling methods:

   - **Resize Scale x2, x3, x4:**
     - ESPCN
     - FSRCNN
     - EDSR (Note: This method may take longer compared to others.)
     
   - **Resize Scale x2, x4, x8:**
     - LapSRN

3. Choose the desired scale according to the selected upscaling method.
4. *(Optional)* You can compress the image quality after upscaling to reduce its size:
   - Enable the switch button.
   - Choose the compression factor.
5. Save the image using the "Download" button or save it to Google Drive with the "Google Drive" button.

## Image Artefacts Removal

Image enhancement removes all artefacts from your picture. When choosing the enhancement factor, consider the trade-off between artefact removal and preserving fine image details.

**To properly remove artefacts, follow these steps:**

1. Choose your image input.
2. Select an image type from the available choices:
   - RGB image
   - Real-world RGB image
   - Greyscale image
3. Choose the enhancement factor.
4. Save the enhanced image using the "Download" button or save it to Google Drive with the "Google Drive" button.

## Image Full Enhancement

Full Enhancement combines image upscaling and artefacts removal.

**To perform full enhancement, follow these steps:**

1. Complete the steps for both the ["Image Upscaling"](#Image-Upscaling) and ["Image Artefacts Removal"](#Image-Artefacts-Removal) sections mentioned above.
